Create a software application that helps with floor layout:  Following operations should be possible: Add a floor plan: a. User enters an array of coordinate pairs: (a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3,b3), (a4, b4) b. Application validates the input i. Assumptions: 1. Points provided go clockwise starting from one of the corners of the room. 2. Adjacent Room walls form right angles. 3. Corners lie on a Cartesian grid. 4. At least 4 corners must be present. ii. Validations: 1. Coordinates are integers. 2. Walls do not intersect. 3. No diagonal walls. 4. Room has a finite area.  c. Examples: i. (1,1), (2,2) -> illegal, as it would result in the wall going diagonally. Illegal, as it only has two corners. ii. (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1) -> Legal. It is a square. iii. (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1) -> Illegal. With assumption 1 this would lead to an infinite room. iv. (1,1), (1,2,),(0,2),(0,3),(2,3),(2,1) -> Legal, L shaped room.
